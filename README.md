# BirdsiteLIVE

## About

BirdsiteLIVE is an ActivityPub bridge from Twitter, it's mostly a pet project/playground for me to handle ActivityPub concepts. Feel free to deploy your own instance (especially if you plan to follow a lot of users) since it use a proper Twitter API key and therefore will have limited calls ceiling (it won't scale, and it's by design).

## State of development

The code is pretty messy and far from a good state, since it's a playground for me the aim was to understand some AP concepts, not provide a good state-of-the-art codebase. But I might refactor it to make it cleaner. 

## Official instance 

You can find an official (and temporary) instance here: [beta.birdsite.live](https://beta.birdsite.live). This instance can disapear at any time, if you want a long term instance you should install your own or use another one. 

## Installation
